<h2>Jessica McKellar</h2>

<p>Jessica McKellar is an entrepreneur, software engineer, and open source developer from Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA. She is a Director for the Python Software Foundation and an organizer for the <a href="http://bostonpython.com/" target="_blank">largest Python user group in the world</a>. With that group she runs the <a href="http://bostonpythonworkshop.com/" target="_blank">Boston Python Workshop</a> -- an introductory programming pipeline that has brought hundreds of women into the local Python community and is being replicated in cities across the US. Jessica is a veteran open source contributor and a maintainer for several open source projects, including OpenHatch and the Twisted event-driven networking engine; she wrote a <a href="http://www.aosabook.org/en/twisted.html" target="_blank">chapter on Twisted</a> for The Architecture of Open Source Applications Volume II and the second edition of O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s Twisted Networking Essentials.</p>


<h2>Fernando P&eacute;rez</h2>

<p>Fernando P&eacute;rez is a research scientist at UC Berkeley, working at the intersection of high-level scientific computing with open tools and brain imaging. He started the IPython project in 2001, while a graduate student in Physics at CU Boulder. He continues to lead a talented team (who do all the hard work) to develop IPython as the interface between the humans at the keyboard and the bits in the machine.</p>

<p>He is a founding member of NumFOCUS, a PSF member, and received the 2012 Award for the Advancement of Free Software for IPython and his contributions to scientific Python. He is a founding investigator of the Berkeley Institute for Data Science, created in 2013.</p>

<p>When he can get away from a computer, Fernando tries to enjoy the mountains and the outdoors hiking, backpacking and climbing. For more information, see <a href="http://fperez.org/" target="_blank">http://fperez.org</a>.</p>

<h2>Andreas Kl&ouml;ckner</h2>
<p>Andreas Kl&ouml;ckner is an assistant professor in the <a href="http://scicomp.cs.illinois.edu">scientific computing group</a> within the <a href="http://cs.illinois.edu">Department of Computer Science</a> at the <a href="http://illinois.edu">University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</a>. He works on high-order numerical methods for the simulation of wave problems as well as issues in high-performance scientific computing that relate to bringing these methods to life on large-scale parallel computers. In support of his research, Dr. Kl&ouml;ckner has released numerous software packages for scientific computing in Python, including <a href="http://documen.tician.de/pyopencl/">PyOpenCL</a>, <a href="http://documen.tician.de/pycuda/">PyCUDA</a> and the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pudb">PuDB</a> Python debugger. He obtained his PhD degree at the <a href="http://www.dam.brown.edu">Division of Applied Mathematics</a> at Brown University with Jan Hesthaven, working on large-scale finite element simulations of wave problems in the time domain. From Brown, Kl&ouml;ckner moved to the <a href="http://cims.nyu.edu">Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences</a> at New York University as a Courant Instructor, where he worked on integral equation methods and fast algorithms within Leslie Greengard's group.</p>
