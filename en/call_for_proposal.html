</ul>

<p>In addition to regular and lightning talks, you can also submit proposals for tutorials and for SciPy Track.</p>

<h2>SciPy Track</h2>
<p>This year, we open a special, dedicated SciPy track for scientific Python. In this special track, we hope to gather practitioners who use the language for scientific, engineering, or scholarly works. Scientific Pythonistas often look at different points of Python than the general community, and have made this language very special.</p>

<p>The conference provides this SciPy track for those people to focus on their needs. <b>Submissions of the SciPy track will be peer reviewed, therefore, speakers are expected to submit an extended abstract with 1 to 3 pages of A4 paper. Language of the track is English only.</b> Suitable topics of the SciPy track include but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Scientific Computing, Technical Computing, High-Performance Computing</li>
    <li>Scientific/Engineering Education</li>
    <li>Computational Sciences</li>
    <li>Bioinformatics</li>
    <li>Big Data, Data Mining, Machine Learning</li>
    <li>Computational Physics, Computational Chemistry, Computational Fluid Dynamics, Computational Mechanics, Computational Electromagnetics</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tutorials</h2>
<p>We are looking for tutorials that can grow our community at any level. Each tutorial is 6-hour long in one day, and scheduled on Friday - the day preceding the main conference.
Any topics that are relevant to Pythonistas' interests are welcome.</p>
