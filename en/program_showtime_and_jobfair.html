<h1>Sponsors' Show Time and Job Fair</h1>
<p>This year, we are going to bring you perfect events for benefitting the
    relationship between participants and sponsors: The <b>Sponsors' Show Time</b>
    and <b>Job Fair</b>!</p>

<h2>What is it?</h2>
<h3>Sponsors' Show Time </h3>
<p>Like a carnival, it is a party we encourage our sponsors to show their
    products, culture, and even what they can do for you! All you need to
    do is to walk around the booth area, take a look on what's going on
    there. We guarantee you would find something really impressing you.</p>

<p>Hey, don't just looking around! This event also encourages you to get
    involved and further socialized with our sponsors. You could exchange
    your name card, introduce yourself, and dig into their culture.
    This is definitely important because it will not only catch your eyes
    but also there is a <b>JOB FAIR</b> coming right on next day.</p>
<h3>Job Fair </h3>

<p>
After introducing the insight of those companies to you, Job Fair is the day
we prepared for those looking for new opportunities, planning to cultivate
new skills, or eager to work on gorgeous projects.
</p>

<p>How about go through a face-to-face interview then?!</p>

<p>There are several tables just near the booth, so you and your interviewer
    an go through a deep communication from your career plan and what you
    wanna be. Don't hesitate to meet our sponsors, cause we believe you can
    earn more from this.</p>
